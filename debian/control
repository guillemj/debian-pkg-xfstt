Description: TrueType Font Server for X11
 xfstt means "X11 Font Server for TrueType fonts".
 TrueType fonts are generally regarded to be the best scalable fonts
 for displays. Applications needing scalable fonts that are to be
 displayed on a screen benefit most.
 This server will allow X11 applications to use the exact same fonts
 as the TrueType fonts used on most Windows Machines.

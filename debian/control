Description: TrueType Font Server for X11
 xfstt means "X11 Font Server for TT fonts".
 TT fonts are generally regarded to be the best scalable fonts
 for displays. Applications needing scalable fonts that are to
 be displayed on a screen benefit most.
 This server will allow X11 applications to use the exact same
 fonts as the TrueType fonts used on most Windows Machines.
 NB: This package contains NO FONTS. They MUST be obtained separately.

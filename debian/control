Description: X Font Server for TrueType fonts
 TrueType fonts are generally regarded to be the best scalable fonts
 for displays. Applications needing scalable fonts that are to be
 displayed on a screen benefit most.
 This server will allow X11 applications to use the exact same fonts
 as the TrueType fonts used on Windows operating systems.
 .
 Note: This package does not contain fonts. They must be obtained separately.

_Description: Do you want xfstt to listen on a TCP port?
 Xfstt runs as superuser, but only before a connection is established with
 the client, then it drops superuser privileges and is run as user nobody.
 .
 This approach is fairly secure, but if you are not going to provide fonts
 to remote hosts, it is recommended to not listen to network connections.

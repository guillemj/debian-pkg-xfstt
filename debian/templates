Template: xfstt/fonts_not_provided
Type: note
Description: Fonts not provided by this package
 It appears you have installed fonts in /var/ttfonts
 from a previous version of xfstt. This has been changed and
 xfstt now uses /usr/share/fonts/truetype. Please place any
 truetype fonts in that location.

Template: xfstt/default_port_changed
Type: note
Description: Server port changed to 7101
 Due to a conflict with xfs (X Font Server), in version 0.99.10
 the default port was changed. If you have X11 still configured
 to use port 7100 for xfstt, please modify your configuration
 to reflect this change. See xfstt(1) manual page.

Template: xfstt/listen_tcp
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Do you want xfstt to listen on a TCP port?
 Xfstt runs as superuser, but only before a connection is
 stablished with the client, then it drops superuser privileges
 and is run as user nobody.
 .
 This approach is fairly secure, but if you are not going
 to provide fonts to other hosts, it is recommended to not
 listen on network connections.
